# Cryptocurrency-Dashboard

### Problem Statement / Opportunity: To help one understand the factors affecting the prices of the cryptocurrencies and also to help make future predictions in a a better way using Microsoft Power BI and Azure Services.

### Project Description: 
Topics like Block chain, Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash, Ethereum, Ripple etc. are constantly coming in the news articles I read. So I wanted to understand more about them and this project helped me get started. When I wanted to dig deep into the cryptocurrencies, the data scientist inside me started raising questions like: 
1. How many cryptocurrencies are there and what are their prices and valuations? 
2. Why is there a sudden surge in the interest in recent days? 

Hence, the main idea of the project is to analyze the cryptocurrencies prices using Azure Analysis Services and Power BI and to answer the following questions: 
1. How did the historical prices / market capitalizations of various currencies change over time? 
2. What could be the possible future prices of the currencies?
3. Which currencies are more volatile and which ones are more stable? 
4. How does the price fluctuations of currencies correlate with each other? 
5. Are there any seasonal trends in the price fluctuations? 

The data is taken from coinmarketcap.com.
